## Andrew Pimento: Shopify Front-End Developer Internship Application 2022 (Technical Challenge) ## 

Hey! Thank you for taking the time to review my application! :) 
I'm so excited to be sharing this with you. I'd love to be a part of this program and part of the Shopify team. 

Spacestagram is a Javascript React Front-End application using imge files pulled from NASA's Mars Rover Camera Api.  

### Languages, Technologies and Libraries ### 
- Javascript 
- React 
- CSS 
- Axios
- Postman
- Google Fonts 
- NASA's Mars Rover Photos API
- MongoDb

### Experience ###

This was a excellent opportunity for me to practice all the skills I've been learning over the past 12 weeks
as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering immersive program. 

I didn't want to simply meet the basic technical requirements for this challenge. Thus, my aim was to use specific visual and 
interactive design choices to communicate a strong sense of storytelling and create a delightful user experience.  

I used Postman to check my API calls. It made my work much more efficient.

### Challenges ###
My biggest challemge in building this app, was making sure that my onClick function targeted one specific image file rendered 
after mapping through all the available images form the API.
