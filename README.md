# SPACESTAGRAM #
## Andrew Pimento Front-End Developer Internship Application 2022 ## 

Hey, and thank you for taking the time to review my application! :) 

Spacestagram is a Javascript React Front-End application using imge files pulled from NASA's Mars Rover Camera Api. 

This technical challenge was a excellent opportunity for me to practice all the skills I've been learning over the past 12 weeks
as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering immersive program. 

I didn't want to simply meet the basic technical requirements for this challenge. Thus, my aim was to use specific visual and 
interactive design choices to communicate a strong sense of storytelling, and create a delightful experience for users.
