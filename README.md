## Andrew Pimento: Shopify Front-End Developer Internship Application 2022 ## 

Hey, and thank you for taking the time to review my application! :) 
I'm so excited to be sharing this with you. I'd love to be a part of this program and part of the Shopify team. 

Spacestagram is a Javascript React Front-End application using imge files pulled from NASA's Mars Rover Camera Api. 

### Experience ###
Throughout the process, I used Postman to check my API calls. 
I used Axios to make HTTP Requests

This technical challenge was a excellent opportunity for me to practice all the skills I've been learning over the past 12 weeks
as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering immersive program. 

I didn't want to simply meet the basic technical requirements for this challenge. Thus, my aim was to use specific visual and 
interactive design choices to communicate a strong sense of storytelling, and create a delightful experience for users.

### Challenges ###
My biggest challemge in building this app, was making sure that my onClick function targeted one specific image file rendered 
after mapping through all the available images form the API.
