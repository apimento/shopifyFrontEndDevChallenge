# SPACESTAGRAM #
## Andrew Pimento Front-End Developer Internship Application 2022 ## 

Hey, and thank you for taking the time to review my application! :) 

Spacestagram is a Javascript React Front-End application using imge files pulled from NASA's Mars Rover Camera Api. 

This technical challenge was a excellent opportunity for me to practice all the skills I've been learning over the past 12 weeks
as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering immersive program. Having only started coding this past January, I have been 
completely immersed in learning and using various lamguages, libraries and technologies to not only solve problems, but make 
ideas come to life in didgital space. I'm hooked. 

I wanted to not only meet the basic technical requirements for this challenge, but also use design choices to communicate
a strong sense of storytelling in conveying the world of the app, while create a delightful experience for users.

Below are some wireframes from the app that I built:

My biggest challemge in building this app, was making sure that my onClick function targeted one specific image file rendered 
after mapping through all the available images form the API.

Throughout the process, I used Postman to check my API calls. 
I used Axios to make HTTP Requests
